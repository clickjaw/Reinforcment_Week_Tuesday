### Exercise 1

Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.


### Exercise 2

Define a function maxOfThree() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.



### Exercise 3

Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.


### Exercise 4 

Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiply([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.

### Exercise 5 
Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".






### Stretch Goal Exercise 1

Write a function `lengths` that accepts a single parameter as an argument, namely an array of strings. The function should return an array of numbers where each number is the length of the corresponding string.

 ["hello", "what", "is", "up", "dude"]; => [5, 4, 2, 2, 4]
